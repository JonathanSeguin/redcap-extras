It is intended to be collaborative for those users that register to be a part of this wiki.\r\n\r\n### Blog\r\n**6/19/2014**\r\n\r\nI'm pushing out an initial release of the imagemap hook (compatible with version 5.10 and up).  This allows you to insert an image map into a REDCap project.  The image map field can either be a text question (in which case it will save the selected areas as a comma-separated-list) or it can a be a checkbox question (in which case there should be an option for each selected value).\r\n\r\nAs part of the design I made it so all data is funneled through PHP so you do not need to expose the hooks directory to the outside web - even the images are written to the page as base64 encoded variables so there should be no client-side pulls.\r\n\r\nIf this framework seems acceptable to others, I think we can build a robust set of javascript-based survey extensions for REDCap to add all sorts of features.
